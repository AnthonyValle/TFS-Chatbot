            <h1>How It Works</h1>

            <p>

                This Chatbot was created using TFJS and uses a basic 
                Nueral Network that decides on a responses based on the 
                given inputs

            </p>

            <p>

                The Network is trained using the JS file titled 'data.js' 
                which contains an object called 'dic'

            </p>

            <p>

                This object contains Patterns, Responses, and Context Sets/Filters 
                that are use to make the conversation with the bot possible

            </p>

            <h3>

                NOTE:This bot isn't trained for any advanced nor specific use, its simply a small 
                ML project that was built to get my hands dirty with some nueral networks

            </h3>

            
            <h4>

                You can ask the bot for its name, age, or greet it with 'hello'

            </h4>


            <h4>

                NOTE:If you greet the bot using 'Hello', you must answer its response of 
                'hello how are you' with 'I am good', This is becuase the context is 
                set to greetings and won't answer anything else until' the context is set back to normal
            
            </h4>

            <h4>

                If you want to retrain the model you can click the button titled 
                'TRAIN' and view the console log to check the loss
