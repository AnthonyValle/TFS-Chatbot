This is a simple chatbot created using Tensor flow JS. There is no specific use for this bot as it simply understands when its greeted with 'hello' and asked about its age and name

If you would like to check it out than you may download the files and open it via local browser

NOTE:The front-end of the chatbot was created using vanilla javascript, this was to make the chatbot easy to transer from one html document to another

To transfer it to another html document you must use paste both script tags used in the 'Chatbot' html file, and have all the files within the browser's directory
